# 24-jul-hippos-furniture-store-API
Using a combination of SQL and well architectured Object Oriented Programming in PHP we have been tasked to create a furniture store API for an existing front end website.
We will exercise SOLID principles through planning and implementation.  

1. Create DB structure per design image.
2. Run furnitureStoreDBPopulate.php ONCE.
